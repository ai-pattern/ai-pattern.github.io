    <h1>1st International Workshop on Patterns and Practices of Reliable AI Engineering and Governance (AI-Pattern'24)</h1>

    <h4>October 28th, 2024, in Tsukuba, Japan, co-located with the <a href="https://issre.github.io/2024/">35th IEEE International Symposium on 
      Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2024)</a></h4>

    <h3>Outline and Goal</h3>
    <p>
      The popularity of artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning (ML) techniques, has increased in recent years. 
      AI is used in many domains, including cybersecurity, the Internet of Things, and autonomous cars, 
      and is expanding its impact in scientific research, consumer assistants, and enterprise services through advancements 
      in Generative AI (GenAI). Many works have investigated the mathematics and algorithms on which the AI techniques and 
      models are built, but few have examined system engineering as well as their governance, which ensures AI systems are built, 
      used, and managed to maximize benefits and prevent harms. AI engineering and governance needs to bring together diverse 
      stakeholders across AI algorithms, data science, software/system engineering, compliance, legal, and business teams. 
    </p>

    <p>
      In AI software engineering and governance, there is often a gap between high-level abstract principles and low-level 
      concrete tools and rules. Patterns encapsulating recurrent problems and corresponding solutions under particular contexts 
      and pattern languages as organized and coherent patterns can fill such gaps, resulting in a common ``language'' 
      for various stakeholders involved in often interdisciplinary AI software systems development and governance. 
      Researchers and practitioners study best practices for engineering and governing reliable AI/ML systems to address issues 
      in AI and ML techniques as well as processes, policies, and tools for trustworthy, responsible and safe AI system development 
      and management. Such practices are often formalized as patterns and pattern languages. Major examples are    
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>AI architecture and design patterns, such as software engineering patterns for ML applications [Washizaki22], ML design patterns [Lackshmanan20] and agent design patterns [Liu24]</li>
      <li>AI assurance argument patterns, such as safety case patterns for ML systems [Wozniak20] and security argument patterns for DNN [Zeroual23][Mutsche24]</li>
      <li>Responsible AI engineering and governance patterns, such as patterns for creating trustworthy and safe AI systems [Lu23]</li>
      <li>AI development and management practices, such as lifecycle phase practices [Rahman23]</li>
      <li>Prompt engineering patterns such as prompt pattern catalogue and taxonomy [White23][Sasaki24]</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      While reliable AI engineering and governance patterns have been documented, there's still much to uncover in this landscape. 
      This limited understanding hampers adoption, preventing the realization of their full potential. 
      This workshop seeks to improve understanding of the theoretical, social, technological, and practical advances 
      and issues related to patterns and practices in reliable AI engineering and governance. It will provide the opportunity 
      to bring together researchers and practitioners and discuss the future prospects of this area. 
      The workshop will have accepted position paper presentations to expose the latest research and practices in the area, 
      as well as invited talks, discussions and panels, and collaborative activities.
    </p>
