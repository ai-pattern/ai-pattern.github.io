    <title>AI-Pattern'24: International Workshop on Patterns and Practices of Reliable AI Engineering and Governance</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>1st International Workshop on Patterns and Practices of Reliable AI Engineering and Governance (AI-Pattern'24)</h1>

    <h4>The first International Workshop on Patterns and Practices of Reliable AI Engineering and Governance (AI-Pattern), 
      co-located with the 35th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2024), 
      which will be held in Tsukuba, Japan, from October 28 to 31, 2024.</h4>
   
    <h3>Outline and goals</h3>
    <p>
      In AI software engineering and governance, there is often a gap between high-level abstract principles 
      and low-level concrete tools and rules. Patterns encapsulating recurrent problems and corresponding solutions 
      under particular contexts and pattern languages as organized and coherent patterns can fill such gaps, 
      resulting in a common ``language'' for various stakeholders involved in often interdisciplinary 
      reliable AI software systems development and governance. Although some patterns and practices have been documented 
      in AI engineering and governance, there still needs to be discovered about the landscape of patterns and practices in the area, 
      resulting in limited adoption, which does not live up to their potential. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This workshop seeks to improve understanding of the theoretical, social, technological, and practical advances 
      and issues related to patterns and practices in reliable AI engineering and governance. It will provide the opportunity 
      to bring together researchers and practitioners and discuss the future prospects of this area. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The workshop will have accepted position paper presentations to expose the latest research and practices in the area, 
      as well as invited talks, discussions and panels, and collaborative activities on reliable AI engineering and governance, 
      patterns, practices, and related topics.
