International Workshop on Patterns and Practices of Reliable AI Engineering and Governance (AI-Pattern'24)

Outline of themes and goals of the workshop: 

In AI software engineering and governance, there is often a gap between high-level abstract principles and low-level concrete tools and rules. Patterns encapsulating recurrent problems and corresponding solutions under particular contexts and pattern languages as organized and coherent patterns can fill such gaps, resulting in a common ``language'' for various stakeholders involved in often interdisciplinary reliable AI software systems development and governance. Although some patterns and practices have been documented in AI engineering and governance, there still needs to be discovered about the landscape of patterns and practices in the area, resulting in limited adoption, which does not live up to their potential. 

This workshop seeks to improve understanding of the theoretical, social, technological, and practical advances and issues related to patterns and practices in reliable AI engineering and governance. It will provide the opportunity to bring together researchers and practitioners and discuss the future prospects of this area. 

As for the workshop format, first, we will have short (invited) talks on reliable AI engineering and governance, patterns, practices, or related topics. Second, we will have accepted position paper presentations to expose the latest research and practices in the area. Finally, we will discuss several issues related to these presentations in groups and panels. Potential topics include collaborative pattern mining and organization.
